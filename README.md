# Skin Care: Early Cancer Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Skin Care is a deep learning-based application that allows users to test their skin for early signs of cancer. Users can upload images of their skin lesions, and the system classifies them using a trained deep learning model. The application also generates a downloadable report with the classification results.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Skin Cancer Detection: Upload images for classification.
- 📄 Downloadable Reports: Get a PDF report with results and recommendations.
- 📊 Deep Learning Model: Uses CNN for accurate classification.
- 📡 REST API: Backend powered by Flask.
- 🎨 User-Friendly UI: Built with html,css & javascript.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend: html,css & javascript
Backend: Flask, TensorFlow/Keras
Model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
